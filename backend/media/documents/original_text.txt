Model answer by pie chart  
[In the model answer below the structure is by pie charts. One paragraph describes the first  
pie chart and the second one describes the second pie chart.]  
 
The pie charts compare weekly expenses of the six most common cate gories, in  
typical households, in America and United Kingdom, in 2010. Overall, it is  
obvious from the charts that spending on rent accounted for the largest  
proportion in the UK, whilst in the United States it was food. In addition,  
expenditures on DVDs were the lowest in both of the nations.  
In Britain, the highest proportion was spent on accommodation, which  
accounted for 30%. Food was the second highest item of expense at 18%. The  
British spent exactly the same proportion on going out for entertainment and  
transportation [15%]. The lowest item of expenditure was DVDs at 10%.  
Turning to America, groceries accounted for the highest proportion of  
expenditure at 25%. Transportation entertainment and reading materials each  
accounted for exactly fifteen per cent. As was the case in the UK, the lowest  
proportion was spent on DVDs, with the same percentage of 10%.
